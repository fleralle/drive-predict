# Drive & Predict

## Description
The study aims to predict distinct metrics and categories out of driving data.
How good will it be to tell you if you are a good or bad driver based on your
driving data ? Or may be, to tell the drivers to slow down during turns or increase
their braking distance.
During this study, we will split our work into small feasible tasks.
